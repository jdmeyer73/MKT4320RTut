# Forecasting II (Not Covered)

Data for this chapter:

* The `msales` and `qales` data are used from the `MKT4320BGSU` course package. Load the package and use the `data()` function to load the data.
    ```{r t13loaddata}
    # Load the course package
    library(MKT4320BGSU)
    # Load the data
    data(msales)
    data(qsales)
    ```

## Introduction

While Base R does have some time-series forecasting capabilities, there are several packages that make working with the data and running the analysis easier. For our class, we will be mainly using the `fpp3` package inside of some user-defined functions. The user-defined functions are described briefly below, and then in detail in their own sections.

### User-Defined Functions for Forecasting II

* `acplots` creates ACF and PACF plots needed for ARIMA forecasting
* `tswh.noise` creates a cumulative periodogram and white noise test needed for ARIMA forecasting
* `autoarima` runs an ARIMA model as specified by the user and an automatic search for the "best" model if requested
* `tsplot` produces a time series plot of the data (covered in Forecasting I)
* `fccompare` compares models from saved results after running the methods functions (covered in Forecasting I)

### Packages

You must have the following packages installed to use all of the user-defined functions. If you do not have them installed, you should do so now.

* `fpp3`
* `slider`
* `purrr`
* `dplyr`
* `ggplot2`
* `ggfortify`
* `stringr`
* `cowplot`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load necessary packages
library(fpp3)
library(slider)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggfortify)
library(stringr)
library(cowplot)
```

## `acplots` User Defined Function

* Usage: `acplots(data, tvar="", obs="", datetype=c("ym", "yq", "yw"), h= , lags=, d=, D=c(0,1))`
    * `data` is the name of the dataframe with the time variable and measure variable
    * `tvar` is the variable that identifies the time period (in quotes)
    * `obs` is the variable that identifies the measure (in quotes)
    * `datetype` can be one of three options:
        * `"ym"` if the time period is year-month
        * `"yq"` if the time period is year-quarter
        * `"yw"` if the time period is year-week
    * `h` is an integer indicating the number of holdout/forecast periods
    * `lags` is an integer indicating how many lags should be shown on the plot; default is 25
    * `d` is the order of non-seasonal differencing; default is 0
    * `D` is the order of seasonal differencing; default is 0
* NOTE: The results of this function can be saved to an object.  When doing so, the following objects are returned:
    * `$acf` contains the ACF plot
    * `$pacf` contains the PACF plot

``` {r}
out <- acplots(msales, "t", "sales", "ym", 12,
               lags=25,   # Number of lags to plot
               d=0,       # Non-seasonal differencing
               D=1)       # Seasonal differencing
out$acf
out$pacf
```

## `tswh.noise` User Defined Function

* Usage: `tswh.noise(data, tvar="", obs="", datetype=c("ym", "yq", "yw"), h= , arima=c(p,d,q), sarima=c(P,D,Q))`
    * `data` is the name of the dataframe with the time variable and measure variable
    * `tvar` is the variable that identifies the time period (in quotes)
    * `obs` is the variable that identifies the measure (in quotes)
    * `datetype` can be one of three options:
        * `"ym"` if the time period is year-month
        * `"yq"` if the time period is year-quarter
        * `"yw"` if the time period is year-week
    * `h` is an integer indicating the number of holdout/forecast periods
    * `lags` is an integer indicating how many lags should be shown on the plot; default is 25
    * `arima=(p,d,q)` provides the non-seasonal autoregressive ($p$), differencing ($d$), and moving average ($q$) parameters, in the form of `c(p,d,q)` where the parameters are integers
    * `sarima=(P,D,Q)` provides the seasonal autoregressive ($P$), differencing ($D$), and moving average ($Q$) parameters, in the form of `c(P,D,Q)` where the parameters are integers
* The function will return a cumulative periodogram and results of the Ljung-Box White Noise test

``` {r}
tswh.noise(msales, "t", "sales", "ym", 12,
           arima=c(0,0,0),     # Seasonal parameters
           sarima=c(0,0,0))    # Non-seasonal parameters

tswh.noise(msales, "t", "sales", "ym", 12, c(2,1,0), c(2,1,0))

```

## `autoarima` User Defined Function

* Usage: `tswh.noise(data, tvar="", obs="", datetype=c("ym", "yq", "yw"), h= , arima=c(p,d,q), sarima=c(P,D,Q), auto="")`
    * `data` is the name of the dataframe with the time variable and measure variable
    * `tvar` is the variable that identifies the time period (in quotes)
    * `obs` is the variable that identifies the measure (in quotes)
    * `datetype` can be one of three options:
        * `"ym"` if the time period is year-month
        * `"yq"` if the time period is year-quarter
        * `"yw"` if the time period is year-week
    * `h` is an integer indicating the number of holdout/forecast periods
    * `lags` is an integer indicating how many lags should be shown on the plot; default is 25
    * `arima=(p,d,q)` provides the non-seasonal autoregressive ($p$), differencing ($d$), and moving average ($q$) parameters, in the form of `c(p,d,q)` where the parameters are integers
    * `sarima=(P,D,Q)` provides the seasonal autoregressive ($P$), differencing ($D$), and moving average ($Q$) parameters, in the form of `c(P,D,Q)` where the parameters are integers
    * `auto` can be one of two options:
        * `"Y"` an automatic search is performed to find the "best" model
        * `"N"` an automatic search is not performed
* NOTE 1: The results of this function should be saved to an object.  When doing so, the following objects are returned:
    * `$plot` contains the ARIMA methods plot
    * `$acc` contains the accuracy measures
    * `$fcresplot` contains a plot of the holdout period residuals
    * `$fcresid` is a dataframe of the holdout period residuals (seldom used separately)
    * `$acresid` contains a plot of the ACF/PACF residuals for the model(s)
    * `$wn` contains cumulative periodogram(s) and results of the Ljung-Box White Noise test(s)
* Note 2: If `auto="Y"` is specified, this function can take one to two minutes to run
* Note 3: The model names are:
    * **Self** for the model specified by the user
    * **Auto** for the "best" model if requested by the user

selfonly <- autoarima(msales, "t", "sales", "ym", 12,
