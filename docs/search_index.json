Chris Chapman and Elea McDonnell Feit http://r-marketing.r-forge.r-project.org/index.html 1.1 Introduction 1.1.1 What is R? R is a programming language R is not a statistics program Much different than SPSS, MiniTab, Stata, etc. Does not use a point-and-click interface 1.1.2 Why R? Emerging techniques usually available in R quickly Default educational platform for statistics programs (and spreading to other disciplines) Large and diverse set of analytic tools Powerful plotting options Large community of helpful users R skills are in high demand And R is free 1.1.3 Why NOT R? Steep learning curve Requires programming 1.1.4 What is RStudio? RStudio IDE is an integrated development environment that makes working with R more user friendly Not required to use R, but provides a better interface and environment of writing code, editing code, and creating documents. Complete separate software And RStudio is free 1.1.5 Getting Started 1.1.5.1 Option 1: Install on your Machine Install R base from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) https://cran.r-project.org/ Install RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download 1.1.5.2 Option 2: Use BGSUs Virtual Computing Lab pilot See course website for link 1.1.5.3 Option 3: Use a computer in an on-campus computer lab All computer in on-campus computer labs should have R and RStudio installed 1.1.6 Navigating RStudio As you can see in Figure 1.1, RStudio is typically divided in 4 quadrants. Figure 1.1: RStudio Layout 1.1.6.1 Quadrant 1 The upper-left corner is the source pane. This pane is where the majority of your programming or coding will take place. When working in this pane, the code does not run unless you tell it to run. In addition, the code can be saved to prevent work from being lost. 1.1.6.2 Quadrant 2 The lower-left corner is the console pane. While it contains several tabs, generally the Console tab is the only one used. The console is where R actually evaluates the code. If you run code from the a source pane window, the code will automatically be put into the console pane and evaluated. You can also type code directly into the console pane and receive immediate results. Depending on the code, the results will appear directly in the console or in a tab Quadrant 4. The &gt; symbol shows that the console is ready for input. 1.1.6.3 Quadrant 3 The upper-right corner also contains several tabs, but the Environment and History tabs are the ones used most often. The Environment tab lists all data objects that have been defined in the current session. The History tab is an archive of all commands run in the current session. 1.1.6.4 Quadrant 4 The bottom-right corner also contains several tabs, all of which are used at different times. The Files tab lists all files in the current directory. The Plots tab shows visualizations created during the current session. The Packages tab shows all packages installed as well as which packages are currently loaded. The Help tab contains the help menu. The Viewer tab contains output from code if the code directs it to be displayed there. 1.2 R Language 1.2.1 Basics of R Commands R is case sensitive When using the console, use the keyboard  and  arrow keys to easily cycle through previous commands typed. When using the text editor (i.e., a script file) in the source pane, use the Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut to submit a line of code directly to the console. The entire line does not need to be highlighted; the cursor needs to be anywhere on the line to be submitted. When using the text editor/script file, the # symbol signifies a comment Everything after is ignored It can be on the same line: x &lt;- 100 # Assign 100 to x It can be on separate lines: # Assign 100 to x x &lt;- 100 1.2.2 Operators Mathematical and logical operators are used frequently. Table 1.1: R Operators Description Operator Mathematical addition \\(+\\) subtraction \\(-\\) multiplication \\(*\\) division \\(/\\) exponentiation ^ or \\(**\\) Logical less than &lt; less than or equal to &lt;= greater than &gt; greater than or equal to &gt;= exactly equal to == not equal to != Not x !x x OR y x|y x AND y x&amp;y test if X is TRUE isTRUE(x) 1.3 Packages Packages are collections of functions that have been written to expand the functionality of R. Packages are not automatically included, and if a command is given that is not part of a package installed and loaded, R will give an error message. Therefore, the package must first be installed, and then loaded. 1.3.1 Installing Packages Installing packages is performed with the install.packages(\"\")function, where the name of the package is inside the quotation marks Two packages that used quite often in this course are ggplot2 and dplyr install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) NOTE 1: Packages only need to be installed on your machine once NOTE 2: If using BGSUs Virtual Computing Lab, new packages cannot be installed, but the version in the virtual environment has most of the most common packages pre-installed 1.3.2 Loading Packages Once a package is installed, it has to be loaded with the library() function, where the name of the package is in the parentheses, in order to be used library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) NOTE 1: It is not uncommon to see a variety of messages when loading a package NOTE 2: Packages need to be loaded every time you start a new R session 1.4 Getting Help R has built in help to assist with understanding different functions To access the help, type ? FUNCTION in the console, and the help page for that function will show up in the lower-right pane under the help tab ? mean 1.5 Basic Object Types (and Other Important Stuff) Objects in R include variables, data sets, and functions The assignment operator &lt;- assigns a value to a named object x &lt;- 100 # Assign value 100 to object &#39;x&#39; x # Display object &#39;x&#39; [1] 100 NOTE: In RStudio console or script file, Alt+- will automatically paste the assignment operator As stated before, object names are case sensitive x &lt;- 100 # Assign value 100 to object &#39;x&#39; X # Display object &#39;X&#39; Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;X&#39; not found The print command can also be used to print objects print(x) [1] 100 1.5.1 Vectors Vectors can be created many ways and take many data types One method is to using the c() function, which concatenates individual items x.Num &lt;- c(1, 3.14, 5.49, 10, 20) x.Num [1] 1.00 3.14 5.49 10.00 20.00 x.Log &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) x.Log [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE x.Char &lt;- c(&quot;fr&quot;, &quot;fr&quot;, &quot;jr&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;sr&quot;) x.Char [1] &quot;fr&quot; &quot;fr&quot; &quot;jr&quot; &quot;so&quot; &quot;sr&quot; The class of the vector can be checked with the class() function # Concatenate class functions and print together print(c(class(x.Num), class(x.Log), class(x.Char))) [1] &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;logical&quot; &quot;character&quot; Vectors can only hold a single class/type of value When multiple classes are included, the values are coerced to the most general type x.Mix &lt;- c(1, FALSE, 3.5, &quot;Hello!&quot;) x.Mix [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; &quot;3.5&quot; &quot;Hello!&quot; class(x.Mix) [1] &quot;character&quot; The c() function can be used to add to existing vectors, or combine vectors Type coercion will be applied as needed x2 &lt;- c(x.Num, 25, 50) x.Num [1] 1.00 3.14 5.49 10.00 20.00 x2 [1] 1.00 3.14 5.49 10.00 20.00 25.00 50.00 x3 &lt;- c(x2, &quot;Hello&quot;) x3 [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;3.14&quot; &quot;5.49&quot; &quot;10&quot; &quot;20&quot; &quot;25&quot; &quot;50&quot; &quot;Hello&quot; Math can be applied directly to vectors x.Num [1] 1.00 3.14 5.49 10.00 20.00 x.Num + 100 [1] 101.00 103.14 105.49 110.00 120.00 x.Num * pi [1] 3.141593 9.864601 17.247344 31.415927 62.831853 The length() function provides the length of a vector length(x.Num) [1] 5 length(x.Char) [1] 5 The str() function provide the structure of an object Class, Length, and Value str(x.Num) num [1:5] 1 3.14 5.49 10 20 str(x.Char) chr [1:5] &quot;fr&quot; &quot;fr&quot; &quot;jr&quot; &quot;so&quot; &quot;sr&quot; 1.5.2 Indexing Indexing is used to obtain particular elements of a data structure Vectors are indexed with square brackets, [] # Obtain the third element of the &#39;x.Num&#39; vector x.Num[3] [1] 5.49 Items can be excluded with negative indexing # Obtain all elements except the third element of the &#39;x.Num&#39; vector x.Num[-3] [1] 1.00 3.14 10.00 20.00 Indexing also works with logical operators # Obtain all elements in &#39;x.Num&#39; greater than 5 x.Num[x.Num &gt; 5] [1] 5.49 10.00 20.00 1.5.3 Sequencing Vectors can also be created using sequencing Integer sequencing is done with #:# coding x.Seq &lt;- 1:10 x.Seq [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Sequences can also be used in indexing # Obtain the second through fourth element of the &#39;x.Num&#39; vector x.Num[2:4] [1] 3.14 5.49 10.00 Complex sequencing can be done using the seq() function x.Seq2 &lt;- seq(from=0, to=100, by=20) x.Seq2 [1] 0 20 40 60 80 100 Note: the from=, to= and by= can be excluded x.Seq3 &lt;- seq(0,100,20) x.Seq3 [1] 0 20 40 60 80 100 1.5.4 Missing (and Other Interesting) Values In R, missing values are assigned a special constant, NA NA is not a character value, but a type of its own Any math performed on a value of NA becomes NA x.Scores &lt;- c(85, 93, NA, NA) mean(x.Scores) [1] NA Many commands contain a option, na.rm=TRUE, to ignore NA data when performing the function mean(x.Scores, na.rm=TRUE) [1] 89 NA values can also be removed before performing the function using the na.omit() function mean(na.omit(x.Scores)) [1] 89 R also has special types for infinity, Inf, and undefined numbers (i.e., not a number), NaN To see this in action, take the natural log, log(), of certain numbers log(-1) Warning in log(-1): NaNs produced [1] NaN log(0) [1] -Inf Notice that R provides a warning when the NaN is found 1.5.5 Factors Character data can be converted into nominal factors using the as.factors() function Each unique character value will be a level of the factor Behind the scenes, R stores the values as integers, with a separate list of labels When the data type is set as a factor, R knows how to handle it appropriately in the model The levels can be accessed with the levels() function x.Class &lt;- as.factor(x.Char) str(x.Class) Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;fr&quot;,&quot;jr&quot;,&quot;so&quot;,..: 1 1 2 3 4 levels(x.Class) [1] &quot;fr&quot; &quot;jr&quot; &quot;so&quot; &quot;sr&quot; 1.6 Data Frames Data frames are an object type that deserve special attention 1.6.1 Overview Most common way to handle data sets in R Provide data to statistical functions Think of it like a spreadsheet, or a rectangular object where: Columns are varying data types (i.e., variables) Rows are values in each column (i.e, observations) 1.6.2 Creating a data frame Can construct a data frame with the data.frame() function Takes as input a set of vectors of the same length x.df &lt;- data.frame(x.Num, x.Log, x.Char) x.df x.Num x.Log x.Char 1 1.00 TRUE fr 2 3.14 FALSE fr 3 5.49 TRUE jr 4 10.00 TRUE so 5 20.00 FALSE sr Note that the column names are inherited from the contributing vector Elements can be indexed using [ROW, COLUMN] notation # Obtain the first element of the third row of data frame &#39;x.df&#39; x.df[3,1] [1] 5.49 # Obtain the third element of the second row of data frame &#39;x.df&#39; x.df[2,3] [1] &quot;fr&quot; 1.6.2.1 Using vectors in-line The vectors can be created in line (i.e., not already created) If the vectors are of different length, the shorter vector will be repeated IF the longest vector is divisible by the vector If a single value is provided instead of a vector, it is repeated for all rows x2.df &lt;- data.frame(var1=seq(10,100,10), var2=c(&quot;Yes&quot;,&quot;No&quot;), var3=1:5, var4=100) x2.df var1 var2 var3 var4 1 10 Yes 1 100 2 20 No 2 100 3 30 Yes 3 100 4 40 No 4 100 5 50 Yes 5 100 6 60 No 1 100 7 70 Yes 2 100 8 80 No 3 100 9 90 Yes 4 100 10 100 No 5 100 1.6.3 Viewing a Data Frame There are a few ways to view a data frame Type the data frame name in the console x.df x.Num x.Log x.Char 1 1.00 TRUE fr 2 3.14 FALSE fr 3 5.49 TRUE jr 4 10.00 TRUE so 5 20.00 FALSE sr With data frames that have many variables, this is cumbersome With data frames with many rows, a max.print setting will kick in and not all rows will be shown To view only a few rows of data, the head(DF, n) function can be used, where DF is the name of the data frame, and n (optional) is the number of rows to view, with 10 as the default NOTE: The Salaries data frame from the car package is being used as an example head(Salaries,5) rank discipline yrs.since.phd yrs.service sex salary 1 Prof B 19 18 Male 139750 2 Prof B 20 16 Male 173200 3 AsstProf B 4 3 Male 79750 4 Prof B 45 39 Male 115000 5 Prof B 40 41 Male 141500 Use the function View() or click on the data frame name in the environment tab to see the data farme in the Source pane See Figure 1.2 Figure 1.2: Viewing a Data Frame in the Source Window Indexing and Sequencing Indices can be left blank, which selects all of that dimension x.df[2, ] # Obtain all of row 2 x.Num x.Log x.Char 2 3.14 FALSE fr x.df[ ,3] # Obtain all of column 3 [1] &quot;fr&quot; &quot;fr&quot; &quot;jr&quot; &quot;so&quot; &quot;sr&quot; As with vectors, indexing can be done with sequencing and negative indices to omit rows x.df[2:3, ] # Obtain rows 2 and 3 x.Num x.Log x.Char 2 3.14 FALSE fr 3 5.49 TRUE jr x.df[ ,-2] # Exclude column 2 x.Num x.Char 1 1.00 fr 2 3.14 fr 3 5.49 jr 4 10.00 so 5 20.00 sr Indexing a data frame returns an object, but the object type depends on the indexing Choosing \\(n\\) rows and and a single column yields a vector of length \\(n\\) Choosing multiple columns returns a new data frame Use the str() function to verify the new objects structure str(x.df[1, 1]) # 1 row and 1 column = vector of length 1 num 1 str(x.df[1:3, 2]) # 3 rows and 1 column = vector of length 3 logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE str(x.df[1, 1:2]) # 1 row and 2 columns = 1 x 2 data frame &#39;data.frame&#39;: 1 obs. of 2 variables: $ x.Num: num 1 $ x.Log: logi TRUE str(x.df[1:4, c(1, 3)]) #4 rows and 2 columns = 4 x 2 data frame &#39;data.frame&#39;: 4 obs. of 2 variables: $ x.Num : num 1 3.14 5.49 10 $ x.Char: chr &quot;fr&quot; &quot;fr&quot; &quot;jr&quot; &quot;so&quot; Data frames can also be indexed using column names after the $ character x.df$x.Char [1] &quot;fr&quot; &quot;fr&quot; &quot;jr&quot; &quot;so&quot; &quot;sr&quot; 1.7 Data Transformations Analysts and researchers often need to create new variables from existing ones or transform existing variables Data transformations can usually be accomplished in more than one way Using base R will be shown first After the dplyr package is introduced, a second way will be shown For the transformations shown below, either a new variable will be added to the data frame, or an existing variable will be changed However, it is not always required that the data frame be changed Sometimes, a transformation will be done on the fly and used only in an analysis, but the data frame remains the same 1.7.1 Creating New Variables Adding a new variable is done using code such as df$new &lt;- SOME FUNCTION, where: df is the name of the data frame new is the name for the new variable SOME FUNCTION is the data transformation to take place # Create new variable &#39;NumSq&#39; that is the square of current variable x.Num x.df$NumSq &lt;- x.df$x.Num^2 x.df x.Num x.Log x.Char NumSq 1 1.00 TRUE fr 1.0000 2 3.14 FALSE fr 9.8596 3 5.49 TRUE jr 30.1401 4 10.00 TRUE so 100.0000 5 20.00 FALSE sr 400.0000 1.7.2 Recoding (Create New) In base R, recoding is usually a multi-step process using indexing # Recode &#39;x.Num&#39; into three factors x.df$Grp &lt;- &quot;low&quot; # Create new variable and set all rows to one level x.df$Grp[x.df$x.Num&gt;=3 &amp; x.df$x.Num&lt;10] &lt;- &quot;med&quot; # Create medium level x.df$Grp[x.df$x.Num&gt;10] &lt;- &quot;high&quot; # Create high level x.df$Grp &lt;- as.factor(x.df$Grp) # Set new variable as factor str(x.df) # See structure of data frame with new variable &#39;data.frame&#39;: 5 obs. of 5 variables: $ x.Num : num 1 3.14 5.49 10 20 $ x.Log : logi TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE $ x.Char: chr &quot;fr&quot; &quot;fr&quot; &quot;jr&quot; &quot;so&quot; ... $ NumSq : num 1 9.86 30.14 100 400 $ Grp : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;high&quot;,&quot;low&quot;,&quot;med&quot;: 2 3 3 2 1 Notice the &amp; in the code above. It stands for and, which tells R that both conditions must be true 1.7.3 Recoding (Change Existing) Recoding to change an existing variable is done in a similar manner NOTE: Sometimes we have to first change the variable type, such as when the existing variable is a factor # Recode &#39;Grp&#39; into only two factors # Change type to &#39;character&#39; x.df$Grp &lt;- as.character(x.df$Grp) # Recode &#39;low&#39; and &#39;med&#39; to &#39;very low&#39; x.df$Grp[x.df$Grp==&quot;low&quot; | x.df$Grp==&quot;med&quot;] &lt;- &quot;very low&quot; # Change back to factor x.df$Grp &lt;- as.factor(x.df$Grp) str(x.df) &#39;data.frame&#39;: 5 obs. of 5 variables: $ x.Num : num 1 3.14 5.49 10 20 $ x.Log : logi TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE $ x.Char: chr &quot;fr&quot; &quot;fr&quot; &quot;jr&quot; &quot;so&quot; ... $ NumSq : num 1 9.86 30.14 100 400 $ Grp : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;high&quot;,&quot;very low&quot;: 2 2 2 2 1 Notice the | in the code above. It stands for or, which tells R that either condition can be true. 1.8 Loading and Saving Data In this class, the data will be provided to you as an .Rdata file, which are specific to R and the best way to store (and load) objects. If desired, .Rdata files can contain multiple objects. For example, an .Rdata file could contain two different data frames. 1.8.1 Setting Working Directory To know where your files are saved to, and to make it easier to load files, it is probably best to have a working directory where existing files are located and where new files will be saved. Use the getwd() function to see your current working directory getwd() [1] &quot;C:/Users/jdmeyer/Docs/RFiles&quot; Set the working directory in one of three ways: Use the setwd() function: setwd(\"C:/Users/jdmeyer/Doc/RFiles/RTutorial\") NOTE: Forward slashes (as shown above) are used in place of backward slashes for directory paths Use the menus in RStudio SessionSet Working DirectoryChoose Directory See Figure 1.3 Figure 1.3: Set Working Direcory using Menus Use the Files tab in the lower-right corner in RStudio See Figure 1.4 Figure 1.4: Set Working Direcory using Files Tab 1.8.2 Loading .Rdata Use the load(\"FILE LOCATION/NAME\") function to load and .Rdata file Suppose the data set used in Topic 1 (airlinesat.rdata) is in a subdirectory of the working directory called Data load(&quot;Data/airlinesat.rdata&quot;) See 1.5 for a visual example Figure 1.5: Loading Data 1.8.3 Saving .Rdata Use the save(OBJECT, file=\"SAVENAME\") function, where: OBJECT is one or more objects in the current environment separated by commas SAVENAME is the name of the file the objects will be saved to. save(x.df, file=&quot;xdf.rdata&quot;) 1.9 User Defined Functions Often, a series of commands is repeated over and over, or there is not an easy, built-in function in R to provide a needed result. In these case, R makes it relatively easy to create your own functions 1.9.1 Structure A function is constructed in the in the following manner: function.name &lt;- function(arglist) {body} where function.name is the name of the user defined function (arglist) contains the names of any inputs to the function, separated by commas {body} contains the code that operates on the inputs The function must be executed prior to using it in the current session; alternatively, the function can be saved as a .R script file and sourced using the source() function in R 1.9.2 Example Suppose a function is need to take the square root of a natural log transformation The new function will be named sqlog and will have one argument # Define the new function sqlog &lt;- function(x) { # Function has one argument, &#39;x&#39; sqrt(log(x)) # What is done with the argument, &#39;x&#39; } Now that the function is created and ran, it can be used. In this case, the output will be printed to the console. The function could have been written in a way that the result is stored as an object. sqlog(100) # Using the function on a single number [1] 2.145966 myvals &lt;- c(5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160) # Creating a vector of values sqlog(myvals) # Using the function on a vector [1] 1.268636 1.517427 1.730818 1.920646 2.093329 2.252815 1.10 Package dplyr The dplyr package (pronounced DEE ply er) is a package that makes data manipulation much easier and more intuitive (for most). dplyr is built around the five main verbs shown below that make up a majority of data manipulation. However, there are other functions that dplyr uses to also help with data manipulation. select is used to subset columns filter is used to subset rows arrange is used to sort rows mutate is used to add new columns based on calculations (usually with other columns) summarise is use to perform summary calculations (e.g., mean, max, etc.) on data set In addition, dplyr uses the pipe, %&gt;%, to string together a series of functions. Think of functions strung together as upstream and downstream functions. The function to the left of %&gt;% is the upstream function, while the function to the right is the downstream function. By default, the downstream function assumes the value coming from the upstream function is the first argument in its function Therefore, the first argument can be omitted If the downstream function needs to use the value from from the upstream function assigned to a different argument, a . is simply put in the position of that argument 1.10.1 dplyr Examples First, be sure the dplyr package is loaded: library(dplyr) Well be using the airlinesat dataset from the airlinesat.rdata file for these examples. 1.10.1.1 select() function Usage: select(.data, ...), where ... is one or more unquoted expressions separated by commas airlinesat has 70 variables, but 46 of them are a series of expectation (e1 to e23) and satisfaction (s1 to s23)scales.

While the package has a great deal of funcationality, this tutorial will only focus on a some of the most common elements. Probably the most useful capability of lubridate is its ability to quickly parse out parts of a text date string, no matter the form of that string. Fast parsing is done through a series of functions that are based on the order of the parts of date/time in the text string. Use ymd() if the order is year, month, day, such as 20101215 or 16/7/1 Use mdy() if the order is month, day, year, such as January 25, 2016 or 5/29/1993 Use dmy() if the order is day, month, year, such as 171210 or 5 January 1990 The results will be the in the format YYYY-MM-DD and have a Date class library(lubridate) ymd(c(&quot;20101215&quot;, &quot;16/7/1&quot;)) [1] &quot;2010-12-15&quot; &quot;2016-07-01&quot; mdy(c(&quot;January 25, 2016&quot;, &quot;5/29/1993&quot;)) [1] &quot;2016-01-25&quot; &quot;1993-05-29&quot; dmy(c(&quot;171210&quot;, &quot;5 January 1990&quot;)) [1] &quot;2010-12-17&quot; &quot;1990-01-05&quot; If time is also included in the text string, that can also be parsed out, such as ymd_hms() where hms stands for hours, minutes, seconds Additionally, lubridate can easily pull out the specific components that are have class Date year(x) returns the year number month(x) returns the number of the month month(x, label=TRUE) returns the month name (abbreviated) day(x) (or mday(x)) returns the number of the day of the month wday(x) returns the number of the day in week, where Sunday = 1 wday(x, label=TRUE) returns the day of the week name (abbreviated) yday(x) returns the number of the day of the year # Use lubridate to create a date class object for my birthday (not really) mybday &lt;- mdy(&quot;March 15, 1973&quot;) year(mybday) [1] 1973 month(mybday) [1] 3 month(mybday, label=TRUE) [1] Mar 12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec day(mybday) [1] 15 wday(mybday) [1] 5 wday(mybday, label=TRUE) [1] Thu Levels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat yday(mybday) [1] 74 1.12 RMarkdown RMarkdown allows users to create documents that combine code and text. Ultimately, they are used for reproducible research. That is, the R Markdown files allow other people to see exactly what was done, and if the data is available to all, other people can reproduce the research. In this class, RMarkdown will be used for the lab assignments. You will write your code in the RMarkdown file, and answer the assignment questions with the code your have written. While RMarkdown has a great deal of functionality, we will focus on a select few of those features. This cheatsheet may be beneficial. 1.12.1 YAML Header The top of every RMarkdown is a section called the YAML header, which is enclosed at the top and bottom with ---. For this class, the only think in the YAML header that you will need to change is the author: section. Figure 1.6: Change Author in YAML Header 1.12.2 Markdown Syntax When writing text in RMarkdown, there isnt a point and click menu to change fonts size or to add italics or bold text or to insert an equation. Instead, it requires the use of markdown syntax. The most commonly used are provided below: Plain text Plain text *Italic* Italic **Bold** Bold ***Bold and Italic*** Bold and Italic # Header 1 Header 1 ## Header 2 Header 2 ### Header 3 Header 3 #### Header 4 Header 4 * Unordered list item * Item 2 * Item 2a (indent 4 spaces) * Item 2b Unordered list item Item 2 Item 2a (indent 4 spaces) Item 2b 1. Ordered list item 2. Item 2 1. Item 2a (indent 4 spaces) 2. Item 2b Ordered list item Item 2 Item 2a (indent 4 spaces) Item 2b `verbatim code` vertabim code equation: $y=\\alpha+\\betax$ equation: \\(y=\\alpha+\\beta x\\) (See this file for symbols) 1.12.3 Code Chunks One of the greatest things about RMarkdown files is the ability to include code, and run the code, within the RMarkdown file. Putting code in the file is done with code chunks. 1.12.3.1 Inserting a Code Chunk Code chunks can be inserted by clicking on the Insert Chunk button in the document toolbar (see Figure 1.7) or by manually typing in the code chunk (see Figure 1.8) Figure 1.7: Inserting a Code Chunk from the Toolbar Figure 1.8: Inserting a Code Chunk Manually 1.12.3.2 Using Code Chunks RMarkdown doesnt pay attention to anything else going on in your R/RStudio session Any objects, data, packages, or user defined scripts must be in a code chunk in RMarkdown However, once they are loaded in a chunk, they do not need to be loaded again in subsequent chunks To run a code chunk, click on the green triangle ( If you run a chunk that does have the necessary object, data, etc., you will get an error message (see Figure 1.9) Figure 1.9: Chunk Error If you need to run previous chunks to load data or packages, click on the gray triangle with the green bar underneath () first, then click on the green triangle (see Figure 1.10) Figure 1.10: Run Previous Chunks, then Run Chunk Once the chunk runs correctly, the result will be shown under the chunk To clear the result, click on the x in the upper right hand corner of the results 1.12.3.3 Knitting the Results At any time, you can Knit the RMarkdown file to an HTML document or a PDF document. While working through the document, HTML is usually quicker. When the document is completed, a PDF is more professional looking (and for this course, required to turn in the lab assignment). To Knit the file, click on the down arrow next to Knit in the document toolbar, and select how you would like to product the document (see Figure 1.11) By default, a document knitted to HTML will be viewable in the Viewer window in the lower right hand side of RStudio. For documents knitted to PDF, RStudio generally opens up a new window with the knitted PDF, from which the file can be saved to a local directory Figure 1.11: Knit a Document "],["examining-and-summarizing-data.html", "Chapter 2 Examining and Summarizing Data 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Visualizations 2.3 Tables and Statistics", " Chapter 2 Examining and Summarizing Data Sources for this chapter: ggplot2: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/ 2.1 Introduction Examining and summarizing data involves visualizations (e.g., graphs and charts) and tables. For visualization, the most popular package in R is th ggplot2 package. For this part of the tutorial, the airlinesat.rdata data file is used, which contains the airlinesat dataframe. You should load this data now:load(\"airlinesat.rdata\") 2.2 Visualizations 2.2.1 Package ggplot2 2.2.1.1 Introduction First, make sure the ggplot2 library is loaded: library(ggplot2) ggplot2 is based on the basic idea that for a graph, we need three things: Data: ggplot2 is designed to work with data frames Coordinate system: what are the x and y variables Geoms: how is the data being represented (e.g., points, lines, etc.) AND that the plot can be enhance by adding more layers, using + When ggplot is used in the console or from a script, the plot appears in the Viewer tab of the lower-right corner 2.2.1.2 Usage A plot starts with the ggplot() function, which requires two arguments: Source of the data, which can be piped in (i.e., %&gt;%) The mapping of the data components This argument is an aesthetic function, aes(), which maps the variable(s) to the coordinate system If the ggplot() function alone is used, the output is simply the coordinate system, but with nothing plotted Because a geom hasnt been requested ggplot(airlinesat, # Use data frame &#39;airlinesat&#39; aes(x=country, y=nflights)) # Map &#39;country&#39; on x and &#39;nflights&#39; on y Figure 2.1: Call to ggplot() without a geom Other parts of the plot are adding in layers, using + A good analogy is building a house: The call to ggplot() is the foundation, but the structure is built one layer at a time Example: Request a column chart for a discrete x and a continuous y ggplot(airlinesat, # Use data frame &#39;airlinesat&#39; aes(x=country, y=nflights)) + # Map &#39;country&#39; on x and &#39;nflights&#39; on y geom_col() # Ask for column chart as the geom Figure 2.2: ggplot() + geom_col() NOTE: Each geom has a default statistic to plot In this case, it is summing the nflights variable by country We can use dplyr and ggplot2 together to get a different value, such as the mean # Use airlinesat data airlinesat %&gt;% # Group data by &#39;country&#39; group_by(country) %&gt;% # Create summary statistic summarise(mean_nflights=mean(nflights, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;% # Pass this results to ggplot and start the plot ggplot(aes(x=country, y=mean_nflights)) + # Note dataset was `piped` # Request column geom geom_col() Figure 2.3: Using dplyr before ggplot to get mean values Using ggplot() can get much more advanced. As the tutorial progresses, many examples of additional layers to a ggplot() will be shown. 2.2.2 Bar and Column Charts In ggplot, bar charts, geom_bar(), are used for plotting a single discrete variable, while column charts, geom_col(), are used for plotting a discrete variable on the x axis and a continuous variable on the y axis. 2.2.2.1 Bar Charts The standard bar chart provides a count of observations of each category of discrete variable x airlinesat %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=gender)) + geom_bar() Figure 2.4: Standard bar chart To get percentages of each category, we need to summarize the data and calculate the proportion for each category airlinesat %&gt;% group_by(gender) %&gt;% # Group data by gender summarise(n=n()) %&gt;% # Create variable with count of each gender mutate(prop=n/sum(n)) %&gt;% # Create variable with proportion by gender ggplot(aes(x=gender, # Variable for the x-axis y=prop)) + # Use &#39;prop&#39; instead of default counts for y-axis geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) # Use the value of y as-is Figure 2.5: Bar chart with proportions To make the chart pretty, we change the color of each bar we can add layers for axis labels, use the scales package to have the y-axis show percent, add labels for the bars etc. airlinesat %&gt;% group_by(gender) %&gt;% # Group data by gender summarise(n=n()) %&gt;% # Create variable with count of each gender mutate(prop=n/sum(n)) %&gt;% # Create variable with proportion by gender ggplot(aes(x=gender, # Variable for the x-axis y=prop, # Use &#39;prop&#39;

By default, the y-axis is a count of observations in each bin of the x variable A bin is a range of values of the continuous x variable By default, ggplot will produce a histogram with 30 bins, and a message is produced to that effect unless the bins are changed manually airlinesat %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=age)) + geom_histogram() `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Figure 2.13: Standard histogram 2.2.3.1 Changing Bins Histograms can look quite different based on the bins used. Bins can be changed in two ways: (1) number of bins; and (2) bin width Changing the number of bins is done with the bins= option For example: geom_histogram(bins=20) Changing the bin width is done with the binwidth= option For example; geom_histogram(binwidth=5) Use the interactive histograms (Figure 2.14 and Figure 2.15 to see how the histograms change Figure 2.14: Interactive histogram for number of bins Figure 2.15: Interactive histogram for bin width 2.2.3.2 Improving the Look You may find the default histogram a little blah or tough to read.

Some additional packages may be used for prettier tables or extracting results to make useful plots. 3.2 The lm() Function Basic linear regression is performed using the lm() function. Usage: lm(formula, data) In R, a formula is represented by dependent variables on the left side separated from the independent variables on the right side by a tilde(~), such as: dv ~ iv1 + iv2 For interactions between independent variables, use either * or : * will include the interaction term AND each main effect : will include ONLY the iteraction term Examples: y ~ x1 + x2*x3 is the same as: \\(y=x_1+x_2+x_3+(x_2\\times x_3)\\) y ~ x1 + x2:x3 is the same as: \\(y=x_1+(x_2\\times x_3)\\) y ~ x1 + x2 + x2:x3 is the same as: \\(y=x_1+x_2+(x_2\\times x_3)\\) If lm() is run by itself, R only outputs the coefficients lm(nps ~ age + nflights, airlinesat) Call: lm(formula = nps ~ age + nflights, data = airlinesat) Coefficients: (Intercept) age nflights 6.786100 0.016985 -0.009112 Table 3.1: Coefficients from lm() call However, if the results of the lm() call are assigned to an object, the summary() function can be used to get much more detailed output model1 &lt;- lm(nps ~ age + nflights, airlinesat) summary(model1) Call: lm(formula = nps ~ age + nflights, data = airlinesat) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.988 -1.316 0.440 1.725 7.682 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

This function is used in the margin plots covered in the next two sections. To use this function, we must pass a data frame of values to the function, where the data frame contains ALL of the IVs and the value for each IV that we want. Suppose we wanted to predict, with a confidence interval, the nps of someone that is 45 years old and had 25 flights on the airline, and also someone that is 25 years old and had 45 flights on the airline. First, we create the data frame of values (see 1.6.2.1): values &lt;- data.frame(age=c(45, 25), nflights=c(25, 45)) # Create data frame values # Verify values age nflights 1 45 25 2 25 45 Second the data frame is passed to the predict.lm() function with confidence intervals requested: predict.lm(model1, # The model we are using to predict values, # The data frame of values to predict with interval=&quot;confidence&quot;) # Request confidence interval fit lwr upr 1 7.322601 7.153951 7.491252 2 6.800657 6.431058 7.170255 3.4 Margin Plots In R, margin plots are a multistep process: Create a data frame of IV values to use in the prediction. For the variable of interest, this is usually a sequence of values from about the minimum to about the maximum For other variables in the model: Continuous variables are usually evaluated an the sample mean Factor variables are usually evaluated at each level of the factor Use the predict.lm() function to use the model results to predict the linear fit of the simulated observations in the new data frame Use ggplot to create the margin plot # Want to predict &#39;nps&#39; for different levels of &#39;age&#39; # when &#39;nflights&#39; is at the mean # First, create a data frame of values to predict, using the &#39;crossing&#39; # function from the &#39;tidyr&#39; package library(tidyr) # Load tidyr # NOTE: variable names must be EXACTLY the same as in original model pred_iv &lt;- crossing(age=seq(15, 105, 10), # Different values of &#39;age&#39; nflights=mean(airlinesat$nflights, # mean &#39;nflights&#39; na.rm=TRUE)) # remove missing values # Use the model results to predict &#39;nps&#39; for values in &#39;pred_iv&#39; data frame # Predicted values and confidence intervals get appended to data frame # New variables are called: # &#39;pred$fit&#39; = linear prediction from model # &#39;pred$lwr&#39; = lower confidence interval for prediction # &#39;pred$upr&#39; = upper confidcent interval for prediction pred_iv$pred &lt;- as.data.frame( predict.lm(model1, pred_iv, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;)) # &#39;pred_iv&#39; now contains all necessary information for margin plot pred_iv %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=age, # Age on x-axis y=pred$fit)) + # &#39;nps&#39; prediction on y-axis geom_line(size=1) + # Draw predicted line geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=pred$lwr, # Draws the confidence interval bands ymax=pred$upr), alpha=0.2) + # Sets transparency level labs(x=&quot;Age&quot;, y=&quot;Linear Prediciton&quot;) Figure 3.1: Single margin plot 3.4.1 Separate Margin Plots If creating separate plots for each continuous IV, it is best to have the prediction (y) variable have the same scale Doing so might take some trial and error after looking at graphs once Use the function plot_grid() from the cowplot package to make the plots appear in the same figure Save each plot as an object, then pass the objects to plot_grid() library(cowplot) # Ask for min and max of the 95% confidence bands to adjust y-axis min(pred_iv$pred$lwr) [1] 6.491185 max(pred_iv$pred$upr) [1] 9.085342 # Save previous plot (for &#39;age&#39;) as plot 1 plot1 &lt;- pred_iv %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=age, # Age on x-axis y=pred$fit)) + # &#39;nps&#39; prediction on y-axis geom_line(size=1) + # Draw predicted line geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=pred$lwr, # Draws the confidence interval bands ymax=pred$upr), alpha=0.2) + # Sets transparency level labs(x=&quot;Age&quot;, y=&quot;Linear Prediciton&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(5.25,9.25)) # Set scale limits for y-axis # Create second plot for &#39;nflights&#39; and save as plot 2 pred_iv &lt;- crossing(nflights=seq(0, 150, 15), age=mean(airlinesat$age, na.rm=TRUE)) pred_iv$pred &lt;- as.data.frame( predict.lm(model1, pred_iv, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;)) min(pred_iv$pred$lwr) [1] 5.319659 max(pred_iv$pred$upr) [1] 7.809707 plot2 &lt;- pred_iv %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=nflights, y=pred$fit)) + geom_line(size=1) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=pred$lwr,ymax=pred$upr),alpha=0.2) + labs(x=&quot;Number of Flights&quot;, y=&quot;Linear Prediciton&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(5.25,9.25)) # Set scale limits for y-axis plot_grid(plot1,plot2) Figure 3.2: Separate margin plots 3.4.2 Continuous IV at Levels of Factor IV Margin plots when one of the variables is a factor variable are done in much the same way, but require an aes(color=factor) to produce different lines for each level of the factor model2 &lt;- lm(nps ~ age*flight_purpose, airlinesat) summary(model2) Call: lm(formula = nps ~ age * flight_purpose, data = airlinesat) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.9197 -1.0779 0.3226 1.8153 4.1003 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
